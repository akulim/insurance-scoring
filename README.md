# Insurance Scoring
## Objective
As the final project of probability class in Pacmann.ai, we are asked to analyze insurance data that includes:
1. Region
2. Gender
3. Age
4. BMI
5. Smoking Status
6. Children
7. Charges
<b>Question:</b> What is affecting the insurance charge?
<br>
The analysis should include probability theories that learnt in class and could fit into answering the problem, such as Bayesian theory, conditional probability, or PMF.
